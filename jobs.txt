- Improve folder structure
	- probably reccomended ways to do this in godot
	
- Improve moving on downwards slopes
	- currently sort of shoot off very quickly

- Ideas

	Boosts:
		A short cooldown
		A camera shake or spark burst
		Limit boosts to one per jump/grapple/swing/etc

	Grapple:
		Visuals
		Grapple set timer
		Grapple cool down
		Grapple ammo



- Snippets

	private Vector2 JumpTowardsMouse() {
		Vector2 velocity = Velocity;
		var mousePos = GetGlobalMousePosition();
		var direction = (mousePos - GlobalPosition).Normalized();
		velocity = direction * JumpForce;
		velocity.Y -= JumpForce * 0.5f;

		isJumping = true;
		return velocity;
	}
